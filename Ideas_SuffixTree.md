A [suffix tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree) is an ordered tree
structure that encodes all suffixes of a string, allowing for particularly
efficient string algorithms.



## Project ##
Design a generic suffix tree library.

A generic prefix tree should be parameterized over its key type (which must
be Iterable), and the weak order (comparison function) used to lexicographically
compare elements in the key.
