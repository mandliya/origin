Origin was started at Kent State University by Andrew Sutton as part of a
project to rewrite the
[http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html Boost Graph
Library] sometime in 2008 using the C++0x programming language. This was an
offshoot from a [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) project. The
primary emphasis of the project involved (and still involves) experimenting with
the designs that would make the library easier to use.


The name "Origin" was actually a name that Andrew proposed as the name of the
KDE development libraries when KDE 4.0 was first being developed and released
and had several new components with neat names (e.g., Plasma, Phonon, etc.). The
word "origin" means (roughly) "a beginning", and is a synonym for "source" (as
in code). KDE didn't want the name, so Andrew kept it.

Andrew recruited several undergraduates who were interested in learning advanced
C++ programming, and started expanding the scope of Origin. Students worked on
C++0x projects including graph data structures, memory layout, trees, hashing
and binning, template metaprogramming, concept checking and emulation. Michael
Lopez, now a PhD student at Texas A&M, is still working on the Origin Graph
library (time permitting).

In 2010, Andrew moved to Texas A&M where he accepted a position as a
postdoctoral researcher with Bjarne Stroustrup, where Origin has become a
central part of his research. In particular, much of his work on concept design
was prototyped in Origin, and is now the concept-checking support in Core.
