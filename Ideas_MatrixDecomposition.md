A matrix decomposition is a factorization of a matrix into some canonical
form. There are a number of different decompositions, each of which is used to
solve different kinds of problems.

## Project ##

Develop a library of matrix decomposition algorithms. Examples of common
decompositions include:

  * LU decomposition
  * QR decomposition
  * Cholesky decomposition
  * Singular value decomposition
  * Spectral dcomposition (or eigendecomposition)

There are many, many others.
