Origin is a collection of experimental libraries written using the C++11 programming language. The purpose of this project is to foster experimentation with library design and programming techniques using the new version of the language.

The Origin libraries is designed around a minimal set of core facilities that wrap and extend the C++ standard library. These facilities include an extensive type traits framework, support for concept-like type checking, new iterator adaptors, ranges, and support for specification testing.

**Note:** Origin is _experimental_ and subject to frequent and often dramatic API changes. This project is not particularly well-suited for production use. Also, C++11 is not broadly supported (Origin is only known to compile against GCC4.8).

restricted and you must either be invited by an active member or request an
